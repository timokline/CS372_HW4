% 1. Modify the square drawing program so that one side of the square is left open
%    (that is, without a visible stroke).
%
%% Drawing a Box
% Draws a one square inch box and inch in from the bottom left

/inch {72 mul} bind def      % Convert inches->points (1/72 inch)
newpath                 % Start a new path
1 inch 1 inch moveto    % an inch in from the lower left
1 inch 0 inch rlineto    % bottom side
0 inch 1 inch rlineto    % right side
-1 inch 0 inch rlineto    % top side
%closepath
stroke                  % Draw the box on the paper

% 2. Modify the program that draws a line at different rotations
%    so that the line being drawn gets longer as the rotation progresses.
%
%% Rotation Example
% Example of rotation... draws 36 lines in a circular pattern

/len 0.1 def

0 10 360 {              % Go from 0 to 360 degrees in 10 degree steps
  newpath               % Start a new path

  gsave                 % Keep rotations temporarily
    288 288 moveto
    rotate              % Rotate by degrees on stack from 'for'
    len inch 0 inch rlineto
    stroke
  grestore              % Get back the unrotated state
  
  /len len 0.1 add def
} for                   % Iterate over angles

% 3. Modify the program that draws a box using translation so that it draws
%    a 3 by 3 array of boxes.
%%Translate
% Draw a box at 72, 72 using translate

% operator box: xcoord ycoord box -
% Creates one inch box at xcoord, ycoord
/box {
   newpath
   moveto
   1 inch 0 inch rlineto
   0 inch 1 inch rlineto
   -1 inch 0 inch rlineto
   closepath
} def

gsave                           % Preserve the old coordinates
  72 72 translate               % Set origin to (72, 72)
  0 0 box stroke                % Draw the box at the new origin
grestore                        % Restore the old coordinates

% 4. Modify the program that draws two boxes and two lines so that the boxes appear to have roughly the same size.

% Define an operator box which builds a path for a one inch square box
% Note that box does not draw or fill the box.

%%%%216 1.5 add 72 2 mul 1.5 add box_adjust stroke  % Draw box above gray one. Check if aligns & same width

% If you try this example, you should note a couple of things.
% Firstly, the black outlined box is a little larger than the gray filled one.
% This extra width comes from the 3 point wide lines used to draw itâ€”they are centered about the path of the box.
% The ink filling the gray box, however, is completely within the path of the box.
% Also, when shading objects, you must be careful. PostScript makes shades through a process called halftoning.
% Basically, uniform dots are placed in various patterns to simulate different shades of grey.
% Unfortunately, various considerations limit how many shades a printer can produce. So some grey tones may come out the same.
% This may be the case with the filled box and the outlined box when viewed on your screen or printer.


% 5. Then modify it again so that the last box is drawn several times at different rotations.

% 6. Write a program of your own that draws something moderately complex, and uses at least one circle or circular arc.
%    To draw a circle or arc, you will need to use the arc command.
