# CS372_HW4
 Do the following exercises:      Modify the square drawing program so that one side of the square is left open (that is, without a visible stroke).     Modify the program that draws a line at different rotations so that the line being drawn gets longer as the rotation progresses.     Modify the program that draws a box using translation so that it draws a 3 by 3 array of boxes.     Modify the program that draws two boxes and two lines so that the boxes appear to have roughly the same size.     Then modify it again so that the last box is drawn several times at different rotations.     Write a program of your own that draws something moderately complex, and uses at least one circle or circular arc. To draw a circle or arc, you will need to use the arc command, described in the tutorial here.
